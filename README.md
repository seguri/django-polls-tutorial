# django-polls-tutorial

This is the solution code to the [Django official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/).

I made it as a quick way to clone a working Django app.

The idea is to have a branch for each version of Django but I won't promise I'll actually do it 😛

Working branches:

- [django-1.10](../../tree/django-1.10)
- [django-1.11](../../tree/django-1.11)
- [django-2.0a1](../../tree/django-2.0a1)
